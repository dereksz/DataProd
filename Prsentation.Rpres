Introduction - Fitting a Linear Model
========================================================

The [mtcars Linear Modeler](http://dereksz.shinyapps.io/mtcars-Linear-Modeler/)
is a fabuleous application for exploring your first linear regression model
using `R`s [`lm`](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/lm.html)
function from the builtin [stats](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/00Index.html) package.

R is a very powerful modelling environment.  In just very small 
amount of code it is possbile to have R solve quite complex modeling
problems.  A simple linear regrassion model can be fitted just with:

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt + am, data = mtcars)
```

And the reults shown with:
```r
summary(fit)
```

Linear Model Output
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
 summary(fit)
```


And Graphs
========================================================

- And the "goodness" of the fit can be determined through 
diagnostic plots:

```{r plot, width=1000}
plot(fit,1); plot(fit,2); 
```

But Why an Interactive Application For This?
========================================================

Because, with an interactive application, you can focus 
you attention on the **changes** that happen to the 
numbers or the graphs as you add or remove explanatory
variables from the fit.

The eye reacts well to these 
"moving images" and picks up on the changes in the 
images much better than if it had to flick focus
between two different graphs or tables.

This app
will certainly make it quicker for you to complete
your factor selection processes.
